## 5. When to Choose MLFlow vs Kubeflow

### Choose MLFlow When:

- **Small to medium teams** focused on experimentation
- **Model tracking and versioning** is the primary need
- **Minimal infrastructure** requirements
- **Framework agnostic** approach preferred
- **Quick setup** and ease of use is priority
- **Not using Kubernetes** in production
- **Individual data scientists** need experiment tracking

### Choose Kubeflow When:

- **Large-scale ML operations** with complex workflows
- **Production ML pipelines** with orchestration needs
- **Already using Kubernetes** infrastructure
- **Distributed training** is a requirement
- **Automated hyperparameter tuning** at scale
- **Multi-step ML workflows** with dependencies
- **Enterprise-grade** MLOps platform needed

### Hybrid Approach:

Many organizations use **both**:

- **MLFlow** for experiment tracking and model registry
- **Kubeflow** for pipeline orchestration and production deployment

**Integration Example:**

```python
# In Kubeflow pipeline component
import mlflow

@dsl.component
def train_with_mlflow():
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://mlflow-server")

    with mlflow.start_run():
        # Training code
        mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

## 10. Decision Framework

### Use This Decision Tree:

```
Do you need complex multi-step pipelines?
├─ No → Do you need experiment tracking and model registry?
│        ├─ Yes → MLFlow
│        └─ No → Consider simpler tools
└─ Yes → Are you already using Kubernetes?
         ├─ Yes → Kubeflow
         └─ No → Do you have resources to manage Kubernetes?
                  ├─ Yes → Kubeflow
                  └─ No → MLFlow + orchestration tool (Airflow/Prefect)
                          OR Vertex AI Pipelines (GCP)
                          OR SageMaker Pipelines (AWS)
```

### Team Size Recommendations:

| Team Size | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **1-5 people** | MLFlow | Low overhead, fast experimentation |
| **5-20 people** | MLFlow + simple orchestration | Balance of features and complexity |
| **20-50 people** | Kubeflow or managed alternatives | Need for standardization |
| **50+ people** | Kubeflow with managed Kubernetes | Enterprise MLOps requirements |

---

## Conclusion

**MLFlow** excels at experiment tracking, model versioning, and simple deployments with minimal infrastructure requirements. It's ideal for data scientists who want to focus on modeling rather than infrastructure.

**Kubeflow** provides a comprehensive MLOps platform with advanced features for production-scale ML workflows, but requires Kubernetes expertise and more infrastructure investment.

**For GCP users**: Vertex AI Pipelines offers the best of both worlds - Kubeflow's pipeline capabilities with Google's managed infrastructure.

**For AWS users**: SageMaker Pipelines provides similar managed experience, though MLFlow + ECS/EKS remains a popular choice.

The choice depends on your team size, infrastructure capabilities, and production requirements. Many organizations successfully run both in parallel, using MLFlow for tracking and Kubeflow for production pipelines.
